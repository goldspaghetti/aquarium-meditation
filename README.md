## CSHS Hackathon - Aquarium Meditation

### Rationale
As our lives get increasingly more stressful, meditation is key to allowing students to clear their minds and take a break. In this VR meditation experience, students will be able to calm themselves in the soothing atmosphere of the bottom of the ocean, guided through simple meditation by Jeff. But wait, you don’t have time to meditate! You still need to study for your CS test tomorrow! Situations like these are an unfortunate reality for many students in our school, leading many students to what is known as “burnout”. To combat this issue relating to the mental wellness of students in our community, we decided to combine meditation and education into one VR experience. Our exercises guide players through simple meditation while teaching programming concepts through visualization through fish, aiming to allow overworked students to take some time to slow down without wasting any time studying for upcoming assessments.
